<h1 class="topictitle1">Relationship between Java DB and
<span>Apache Derby</span></h1>



<div><p>Java DB is a relational database management system that is based on
the Java programming language and SQL. Java DB is the Oracle release of the
Apache Derby project, the Apache Software Foundation's (ASF) open source
relational database project.</p>

<p>The Java DB product includes 
<span>Derby</span> without any 
modification whatsoever to the underlying source code.</p>

<p>Because Java DB and <span>Derby</span> 
have the same functionality, the Java DB documentation refers to the core 
functionality as <span>Derby</span>.</p>

<p>The Java DB <span>10.10</span>
documentation is based 
on the <span>Derby</span> <span>10.10</span> documentation.
References to "<span>Derby</span>" in the
Java DB documentation should be understood as synonyms for "Java DB."</p>

<p>Oracle has made changes to the
<span>Apache Derby</span> documentation. This
manual is identical to the
<cite><span>Derby</span> Reference
Manual</cite>, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle has added this topic, "Relationship between Java DB and
<span>Apache Derby</span>".</li>

<li>In the titles of manuals,
"<span>Derby</span>" has been changed to
"Java DB".</li>

</ul>
